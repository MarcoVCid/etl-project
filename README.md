# etl-project
We want to study and compare how many songs are alike between a spotify music dataset that contains info of music from 1921 to 2020 and the top 50 songs of 2019.

We will use two datasets from Kaggle; the first one being Spotify Dataset 1921 - 2020, 160k+ Tracks (https://www.kaggle.com/yamaerenay/spotify-dataset-19212020-160k-tracks) and the second one being Top 50 Spotify Songs - 2019 (https://www.kaggle.com/leonardopena/top50spotify2019).
